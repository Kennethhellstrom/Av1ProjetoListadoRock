# Hey Kenneth!
I hope you are fine.

First, I need to congratulate you on your project. Unfortunately, our class has changed to another format and, once we were having normal classes, the rest of our meetings has been reduced.

But, anyway, you've used in your project some concepts that we haven't seen in our classes and I think it's very good.

However, to advance on your applications, I want to suggest some points:
### What I want from you for the next weeks:
[ ] To use text or icons instead images on your buttons.
[ ] To store your bands data on the AsyncStorage or in a local database, using SQLite.
You can find ways to do it on the 3rd theme, as in the following list:
> 1. Using the key-value model with AsyncStorage (3rd theme - 1st topic)
> 2. Using a relational database with SQLite (3rd theme - 2nd topic)
> 3. Using the Realm Database (3rd theme - 3rd topic)
> You can choose one of them or more.

- Also, I want to suggest to consume some API about bands. You can create a third page about bands details, news, and curiosities and display it as a list.
I will look and try to find some APIs that you could use in your application (and you can also search for it). When you finish the steps that I've suggested above, you can talk with me and we can check it together.
To do it, I suggest you to check the digital content under SAVA to learn how you can consume an external data source.

### Next steps dates
[ ] Data store with your application: 10/11/2022.
[ ] API Data Consuming: 24/11/2022.

Have fun!
